SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Provides cmdlets for setting up symbol servers and other 
    functionality related to debugging and performance tuning.
           
LONG DESCRIPTION
    This module makes setting up symbol servers and source server debugging 
    functionality easier to control for Visual Studio 2013 through 2017 
    and WinDBG. Setting up a development machine for symbol server 
	access is more difficult than it needs to be but no more.
    
    You can have any combination of Visual Studio 2013 through 2017, and
    WinDBG on the computer for these cmdlets to work.
    
    These cmdlets had been originally developed as PowerShell scripts by John 
    Robbins and released on his blog. This module combines all the separate 
    scripts to make everything easier to manage.
    
    If you have any questions, suggestions, or bug reports, please contact John 
    at john@wintellect.com.
                 
    The following cmdlets are included.
